# URPContainment
The implementation of the URP containment algorithm

To compile, input in the terminal:
- g++ reduce.cpp -o reduce

And then to run the executable file, input:
- ./reduce <in_file> <out_file> <unate_reduction_file>

The <out_file> would store the result of Redundant Cube Removal, and <unate_reduction_file> stores the result of Unate Reduction.
